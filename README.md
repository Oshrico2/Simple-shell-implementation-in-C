# Simple-shell-implementation-in-C
This program is a simple shell implementation in C that allows users to enter commands and executes them in a child process. It uses the PATH environment variable to check for the existence of the entered command and exits when the user enters "leave".





A video from the program, I showed some commands after running the program, in addition, you can see that the path from which the command is taken is indicated as part of the output
